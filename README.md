# ASM Neuron Activations

Efficient routines in NASM assembly for x86-64 architecture providing activation functions commonly used in machine learning and neural networks. This repository offers high-performance calculation demonstrations, proper for low-level applications or environments where performance is critical.

## Features

- **Optimized for x86-64 architecture**: Delivers fast activation function computations for x86-64.
- **Available Activation Functions**:
  - Sigmoid (logistic function)
  - ReLU (rectified linear unit)
  - Tanh (hyperbolic tangent)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **NASM assembler**: Can be installed on Linux using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install nasm

- **Make**: Can be installed on Linux using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install make
